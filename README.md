A pick-up/delivery schedule planning (Artificial Intelligence)



Pickup/Delivery Schedule is supposed to approximate the best path plan as we cannot find the best path with 100% accuracy. Clients provide order with locations in terms of longitude and latitude to pick their packages within a window time. If the pick-up man cannot take their packages in a window or in duty time he/she may encounter some penalty.
